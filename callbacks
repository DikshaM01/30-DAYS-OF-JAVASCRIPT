callbacks in javascript are functions that are passed as arguments to other functinsm
why we use callbacks?
  this is very important feature of the asynchronous programming and it enables the function that receives
  the callback to call our code when it finishes the long task and allowing us to continue the execution
  of the code
var callback=function(){
console.log("Done!"); }
setTimeOut(callback,5000);

setTimeout(function() {
    console.log("Done!");
}, 5000);
