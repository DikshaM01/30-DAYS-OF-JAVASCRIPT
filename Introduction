->console.log(1) ->it will output as 1 , it will simply displays information in any javascript console
->variables are containers that store the information for later use
->let test; //where let is the variable keyword which is used to declaring the variable
->let test; console.log(test); -> it will output undefined because the test variable is only declared not 
initialized. we can assign the variable using assignement operator
->let test;
  test=1;
  console.log(test)
it will give output as 1.
->we can also create a variable using const keyword for example const test=5;
-> the difference between let and const is that you cannot assign a new value to const.
->if you are using const you must initialize it also. you cant just declare it.
->const num;
num=5;
console.log(num) ->it will give error as uncaught syntax error :missing initializer in const declaration
->const value will never get changed-> for example -> const pi=3.14159;
