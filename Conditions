-> if statement
  returns true or false
to know the value if it is true then we use confirm() function
if (confirm("Are you john smith"))
{
console.log("Hello john");
}else
{
console.log("then what is your name")}
console.log("1"==1);=true
-> &&,||,!(NOt operator)
-> switch statement is same as c but one differneve is that it will take strings also
var rank = "Commander";
switch(rank)
{
    case "Private":
    case "Sergeant":
        console.log("You are not authorized.");
        break;
    case "Commander":
        console.log("Hello commander! what can I do for you today?");
        break;
    case "Captain":
        console.log("Hello captain! I will do anything you wish.");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("I don't know what your rank is.");
        break;
}
